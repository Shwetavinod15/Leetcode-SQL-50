Consecutive Numbers

Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.
 

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

SOLUTION:
select distinct N1.num as ConsecutiveNums
from Logs N1
join Logs N2
on N1.id = N2.id - 1
join Logs N3
on N2.id = N3.id - 1
where N1.num = N2.num and N2.num = N3.num
